Welcome to the Wolfpack Community Localization Project! üåê

## About Wolfpack
Wolfpack is an exciting submarine simulation game that allows players to work together as a crew to operate a submarine during World War II. For more information, check out the [official Wolfpack game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/490920/Wolfpack/).

## Project Overview
Since the release of update 0.26, Wolfpack supports community-created languages. This project aims to create and maintain community-driven translations for Wolfpack in various languages. Our goal is to ensure that players from different countries can enjoy the game in their native language.

## Contributing
We have initially generated translations using DeepL for version 0.26, but they may contain errors. If you spot any issues or would like to contribute a translation for your language, feel free to submit a pull request. I will review and merge the changes so that every player can enjoy Wolfpack in their preferred language.

### How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your language (e.g., `0.26/french-translation`)
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

Let's make Wolfpack accessible to players around the world!

Happy gaming! üö¢üåç
